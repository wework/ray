# Governance

Ray is maintained by the [@WeWork/ray-maintainers](https://github.com/orgs/wework/teams/ray-maintainers) group at WeWork.

## Maintainership

If you are a maintainer, or are interested in becoming one, there are a few simple expectations:

1. On some regular basis, contribute to the repository in the form of code reviews or contributions.
2. Be an active participant in discussion on GitHub and in the WeWork internal slack channel [#ray-design-system](https://wework.slack.com/messages/CFLL3QWQ5).
3. Be a Ray evangelist and set a good example for the community by adhering to the [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

In order to sustain a high-quality product, all pull-requests are required to be approved by at least one member of this group.
