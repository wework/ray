<page-intro>Named after Ray Eames, the Ray Design System aims to simplify and unify design across [WeWork](https://wework.com).</page-intro>

### What is a design system?

A design system is a set of patterns and components that can be reused in different combinations to facilitate design and engineering.

### Why start a new design system?

Our current design system in use, Rivendell, has become outdated and unmaintainable. With the refresh of our physical space, our digital space should also reflect WeWork’s design principles and aesthetic.

### Who will it serve?

Ray is currently being defined by the design and engineering teams in POG. It will help serve WeWork.com site and help build cohesion with the web Member Network. Implemented in both Vanilla.JS/CSS/HTML and React for wide developer adoption.

### What are the principles behind it?

Developer adoption and user accessibility should be treated as first-class citizens with Ray. Some of the failures of past design systems overlooked these two principles that will be a priority with Ray.

### What is the purpose of having a [storybook] and a documentation website?

The storybook acts as a workshop for developers to iterate on features. The documentation site serves as a "store-front" for consumers of Ray to understand its value and start using it with as much ease as possible.
